I was sitting in my apartment one day trying to think of a project for my brand new Arduino Uno micro controller. 
The Pixar movie Wall E was on TV, and I was admiring the level of emotions Wall E could display even with a distinctly 
non-human robotic face. My dog Leo was sitting next to me staring up at me with his adoring puppy eyes and it hit me: 
It doesn't matter how realistic or human a face is, emotions can be effectively conveyed through very basic visual movements. 
I could potentially make a very simple robot that could look around and appear to be emotionally responsive! All I had to do 
was make it cute... simple right? The solution was to make the robot unrealistic. I had to actually steer clear of giving it 
human features.

The concept of the "Uncanny Valley" has been around a very long time, and I believe it is crucial to understand what it means 
if you are going to build a robot that will handle human interaction. Katherine Ladd, a blogger over at wordpress 
(KatherineLad.com), describes the Uncanny Valley as

"the place where a robotâ€™s similarity to a human, without being actually exactly like a human, becomes unacceptable and 
downright unsettling."

So I started designing a simple emotional robot. I decided to use two 8x8 LED displays for the eyes because they allow 
flexibility. I can easily tweak them at any time and as often as I want by adjusting the bit maps to my liking. To add 
another more physical emotional trait, I also added micro-servo controlled eyebrows. My theory was that these eyebrows 
along with the eyes and head movement would be the only things I would need to convey my robot's emotions. Last but not 
least, my robot needed a name. And thus, Brobot was born!
